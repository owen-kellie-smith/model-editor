# model-editor

A constrained editor for navigating and modifying large models encoded as declarative formulae, stored in XML.

The editor makes structural relationships explicit: variable dependencies, precedents, dependants, and diffs between model versions.

---

## What’s here

- **The editor**  
  A single-page web tool for exploring and editing models under structural constraints.

- **A restaurant cashflow model**
  Used to demonstrate the editor on a large deterministic model.

- **An aircraft cashflow model**
  Used to demonstrate the editor on a large deterministic model with a different structure.

The models exist to demonstrate the editor, not as standalone simulations.

## What this demonstrates

- Working with large declarative models
- Dependency analysis and visualisation
- Constrained editing and model validity
